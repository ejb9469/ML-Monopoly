VERSION 2.0.1


    - Placed graphical assets (atm just .png images) into new subfolder 'gfx.assets/*'

    - Changed `Judge.decide()` to use ActionState instead of LinkedHashMap<GameAction, GameObject>

    - `MonopolyGraphicsFX`: New static member, `selectedProperty` (to avoid the need to use a JavaFX TextField)
    - Added unmortgage and mortgage buttons
