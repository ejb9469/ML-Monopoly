GAME LOGIC:

    DONE 1) Fix remaining bugs with auction procedure.
        a) It's pretty non-functional overall - pick through it.
        b) Bankrupted Players can still auction.
    2) Figure out what we're doing with async variable. It's deprecated rn and maybe shouldn't be.
    3) Deprecate warn() or apply it to everything new.
    DONE 4) Complete deprecation of `doNotRemoveAction`.
        a) Make pre-and-post actions handled in `endTurn()`
    DONE 5) Implement `gameState` counter for consecutive turns in jail (force bail payment or card use after 3)

    Also:
    *) Change wrapper requirements to make stdin debugging easier.
        We don't really need to specify `wrapper.objProperty` in most cases.


GRAPHICS:

    1) We could render games after they happen via some Demo procedure that would record games in progress.
        This would avoid the need to use Threads or Timelines entirely.
        `Demo` could be the name of a class that does this.
        TODO!!
    DONE 2) Implement Player location, cash, etc.
        NOT DONE Check `GameState` - every field should be shown graphically.
