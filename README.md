MVC-like implementation of Monopoly written in Java. Split into five packages:

1) `/gameobjects` package contains game logic.
2) `/playerobjects` package contains most interactive components and handles \[user\] input.
3) `/gfx` package handles graphical interface using JavaFX.
4) `/neural` package contains all machine learning additions.
5) `/network` package contains all networking (multiplayer) components.
